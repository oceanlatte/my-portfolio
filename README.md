# My Portfolio

## Purpose
This website is to showcase my skills so far using html and advanced CSS to potential employers. I am in my second week of the UW-Madison's Coding Bootcamp and was able to build this with the skills I have learned so far! This project in particular was to show our understanding of flexbox and media queries. As well as some of the more advanced CSS styling.

## Built With

One of my favorite features of this site is the hover pseudo class used on the links in the header and footer!

## Credits
I am very thankful to TA's Ryan and Emily for helping me further understand flexbox to be able to create the "Work" section. This part was very difficult to understand the correct use of flexbox to get the site labels to overlay on the site preview images. I would have struggled for much longer if it wasn't for their help and encouragement!
